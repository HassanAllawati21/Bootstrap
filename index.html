        <p class="lead">Let me introduce myself and tell you my story. I am currently a full time student at CSULB as an international student from Oman, well its complicated so let me tell you a back story. I was born in the Philippines, half filipino from my moms side and half arabic from my dads. I moved to Oman when I was about 8 years old as education in the Philippines was very poor and Oman had more opportunities for higher education. And so I worked my butt off all through highschool in order to get a full scholarship anywhere in the world.

And so I chose Long Beach. Life has been exciting so far and I wonder where I'll end up next whether its to go back home or stay here for a job or even move to another country all together, all exciting! and not very scary since I know 5 languages (not including coding languages). And so yeah, that's me :) P.S I'm a huge star wars fan which explains the picture haha.</p>
